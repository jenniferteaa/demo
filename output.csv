hole in the tube surrounding the spinal cord,"The spinal cord is made from part of the neural tube during development . There are four stages of the spinal cord that arises from the neural tube : The neural plate , neural fold , neural tube , and the spinal cord . Neural differentiation occurs within the spinal cord portion of the tube . As the neural tube begins to develop , the notochord begins to secrete a factor known as Sonic hedgehog or SHH . As a result , the floor plate then also begins to secrete SHH , and this will induce the basal plate to develop motor neurons . During the maturation of the neural tube , its lateral walls thicken and form a longtitudinal groove called the sulcus limitans . This extends the length of the spinal cord into dorsal and ventral portions as well . Meanwhile , the overlying ectoderm secretes bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) . This induces the roof plate to begin to secrete BMP , which will induce the alar plate to develop sensory neurons . Opposing gradients of such morphogens as BMP and SHH form different domains of dividing cells along the dorsal ventral axis . Dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors . As the dorsal and ventral column cells proliferate , the lumen of the neural tube narrows to form the small central canal of the spinal cord . The alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans . Additionally , the floor plate also secretes netrins . The netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure , where they then ascend towards the thalamus .

where was thomas paine's common sense published,"Thomas Paine arrived in the American colonies in November 1774 , shortly before the Battles of Lexington and Concord . Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another , the thought of independence was not initially entertained . Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778 , Paine `` found the disposition of the people such , that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed . Their attachment to Britain was obstinate , and it was , at that time , a kind of treason to speak against it . Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment , and their single object was reconciliation . '' Paine quickly engrained himself in the Philadelphia newspaper business , and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth . Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Philadelphia papers , it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters , leading Paine to select the pamphlet form . Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell , promising Paine that , where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet , Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing . Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Philadelphia 's papers , and demand grew so high as to require a second printing .

loss of memory due to the passage of time during which the memory trace is not used,"Transience refers to forgetting what occurs with the passage of time . Transience occurs during the storage phase of memory , after an experience has been encoded and before it is retrieved . As time passes , the quality of our memory also changes , deteriorating from specific to more general . German philosopher named Hermann Ebbinghaus decided to measure his own memory for lists of nonsense syllables at various times after studying them . He decided to draw out a curve of his forgetting pattern over time . He realized that there is a rapid drop - off in retention during the first tests and there is a slower rate of forgetting later on . Therefore , transience denotes the gradual change of a specific knowledge or idea into more general memories .","Transience, also known as forgetfulness, is the natural process of memory deteriorating over time when not actively accessed. this phenomenon occurs in the storage phase of memory, between encoding and retrieval. german philosopher hermann ebbinghaus conducted experiments on his memory for nonsense syllables and found that there is a rapid initial drop-off in retention followed by a slower rate of forgetting. this supports the idea that memories transition from specific to more general over time."

where do transcription and translation occur in eukaryote cells,"Eukaryotic transcription is the elaborate process that eukaryotic cells use to copy genetic information stored in DNA into units of RNA replica . Gene transcription occurs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells . Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA , RNA polymerase in eukaryotes ( including humans ) comes in three variations , each encoding a different type of gene . A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus that separates the processes of transcription and translation . Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures . The complexity of the eukaryotic genome necessitates a great variety and complexity of gene expression control .","Mitochondria is where transcription and translation occur in eukaryotic cells. mitochondrial transcription is the process by which genes in the mitochondria are copied into rna molecules. mitochondria are unique in that they have their own separate machinery for transcription and translation, separate from the nucleus. this process is essential for the production of proteins needed for mitochondrial function."

where does the cell get energy for active transport processes,"Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants .","The cell gets energy for active transport processes from adenosine triphosphate (atp). unlike passive transport, which relies on kinetic energy and natural entropy, active transport uses cellular energy to move molecules against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. this process is known as primary active transport when it utilizes atp. examples include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants."

This results in teachers and administrators of the school disliking having the child around . When confronted by the situation , the child admits he / she hates school and other peers do n't like him / her . This results in the child acting inappropriately , forcing the administrators who dislike having him / her around to create a more restrictive environment for children of this stature . Each behavioral and environmental factor coincides with the child and so forth resulting in a continuous battle on all three levels .","Bandura 's reciprocal determinism could be illustrated in the bandura 's box experiment. for instance, in a school setting, a child may observe their peers acting out and consequently start acting out themselves. this behavior can lead to negative interactions with teachers and peers, further reinforcing the child's negative feelings towards school. as a result, the child's behavior continues to escalate, creating a cycle of negative reinforcement. this highlights the importance of observational learning in shaping behavior in social settings."

what is the measurement of low or high sound called,"Pitch is perceived as how `` low '' or `` high '' a sound is and represents the cyclic , repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound . For simple sounds , pitch relates to the frequency of the slowest vibration in the sound ( called the fundamental harmonic ) . In the case of complex sounds , pitch perception can vary . Sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound , based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns . Selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations , including their frequencies and the balance between them . Specific attention is given to recognising potential harmonics . Every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high . For example : white noise ( random noise spread evenly across all frequencies ) sounds higher in pitch than pink noise ( random noise spread evenly across octaves ) as white noise has more high frequency content . Figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition . During the listening process , each sound is analysed for a repeating pattern ( See Figure 1 : orange arrows ) and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height ( octave ) and chroma ( note name ) .","Pitch is perceived as the measurement of amplitude of a sound, representing the cyclic, repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound. for simple sounds, pitch relates to the frequency of the slowest vibration in the sound (called the fundamental harmonic). in the case of complex sounds, pitch perception can vary. sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound, based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns. selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations, including their frequencies and the balance between them. specific attention is given to recognizing potential harmonics. every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high. for example, white noise (random noise spread evenly across all frequencies) sounds higher in pitch than pink noise (random noise spread evenly across octaves) as white noise has more high frequency content. figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition. during the listening process, each sound is analyzed for a repeating pattern (orange arrows) and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height (octave) and chroma (note name)."

what type of ion channels is necessary for the function of the axon and the axon terminal,"The neurotransmitter molecule packages ( vesicles ) are created within the neuron , then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit docked . Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 μs of calcium entry . Triggered by the binding of the calcium ions , the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart , resulting in the creation of a fusion pore . The presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft . The process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis , which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane . These membrane - bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment , as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane . Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca triggered and serves interneuronal signalling .","The neurotransmitter molecule packages ( vesicles ) are created within the neuron, then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit docked. potassium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 μs of potassium entry. triggered by the binding of the potassium ions, the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart, resulting in the creation of a fusion pore. the presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. the process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis, which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. these membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is k triggered and serves interneuronal signaling."

what was the official religion of the soviet union,"The Soviet Union was established by the Bolsheviks in 1922 , in place of the Russian Empire . At the time of the 1917 Revolution , the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state , enjoying official status . This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it . Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion , and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief , with the goal of establishing state atheism ( gosateizm ) . Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union , there was a `` government - sponsored program of conversion to atheism '' conducted by Communists . The communist regime targeted religions based on State interests , and while most organized religions were never outlawed , religious property was confiscated , believers were harassed , and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools . In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution . Accordingly , although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned , a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions ( teachers , state bureaucrats , soldiers ) to be openly religious .","The soviet union was established by the bolsheviks in 1922 , in place of the russian empire . at the time of the 1917 revolution , the orthodox christianity church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state , enjoying official status . this was a significant factor that contributed to the bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it . thus the ussr became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion , and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief , with the goal of establishing state atheism ( gosateizm ) . under the doctrine of state atheism in the soviet union , there was a `` government - sponsored program of conversion to atheism '' conducted by communists . the communist regime targeted religions based on state interests , and while most organized religions were never outlawed , religious property was confiscated , believers were harassed , and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools . in 1925 the government founded the league of militant atheists to intensify the persecution . accordingly , although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned , a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions ( teachers , state bureaucrats , soldiers ) to be openly religious ."

who designed the sundial bridge in redding ca,"The Sundial Bridge is a cantilever spar cable - stayed bridge , similar to Calatrava 's earlier design of the Puente del Alamillo in Seville , Spain ( 1992 ) . This type of bridge does not balance the forces by using a symmetrical arrangement of cable forces on each side of its support tower ; instead , it uses a cantilever tower , set at a 42 - degree angle and loaded by cable stays on only one side . This design requires that the spar resist bending and torsional forces and that its foundation resists overturning . While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure , the architectural statement is dramatic .

what does the acrosome do in a sperm cell,"In mammals the acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase and acrosin ; their role in fertilization is not yet clear . The acrosomal reaction does not begin until the sperm comes into contact with the oocyte 's zona pellucida . Upon coming into contact with the zona pellucida , the acrosomal enzymes begin to dissolve and the actin filament comes into contact with the zona pellucida . Once the two meet , a calcium influx occurs , causing a signaling cascade . The cortical granules inside the oocyte then fuse to the outer membrane and a transient fast block reaction occurs .","In mammals, the acrosome plays a crucial role in both fertilization and motility of the sperm cell. during fertilization, the acrosome reaction releases enzymes that aid in the penetration of the oocyte's zona pellucida. this reaction is triggered upon contact between the sperm and the zona pellucida, leading to the dissolution of the acrosomal enzymes and the actin filament interacting with the zona pellucida. this interaction results in a calcium influx, initiating a signaling cascade. additionally, the fusion of cortical granules inside the oocyte's membrane leads to a transient fast block reaction. overall, the acrosome's function is essential for successful fertilization and the propulsion of the sperm cell."

the sense provides information about balance and movement,"The vestibular system , in most mammals , is the sensory system that provides the leading contribution to the sense of balance and spatial orientation for the purpose of coordinating movement with balance . Together with the cochlea , a part of the auditory system , it constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals .

The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control eye movements , and to the muscles that keep an animal upright . The projections to the former provide the anatomical basis of the vestibulo - ocular reflex , which is required for clear vision ; and the projections to the muscles that control posture are necessary to keep an animal upright .","The inner ear is the primary sensory system responsible for providing information about balance and movement in most mammals. alongside the cochlea, which is part of the auditory system, the vestibular system plays a crucial role in coordinating movement with balance. consisting of the semicircular canals for rotational movements and the otoliths for linear accelerations, the vestibular system sends signals to neural structures that control eye movements and muscles that maintain an animal's upright posture. this interplay between the inner ear and other sensory systems is essential for an animal to maintain spatial orientation and coordination during movement."

when did the concept of sustainable development come into existence,"While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report , it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns . As the concept developed , it has shifted to focus more on economic development , social development and environmental protection for future generations . It has been suggested that `` the term ' sustainability ' should be viewed as humanity 's target goal of human - ecosystem equilibrium ( homeostasis ) , while ' sustainable development ' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability '' . The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem , the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature . Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development , turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good . The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called Managed Sustainable Development ( MSD ) .","While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 brundtland report, some argue that the concept actually dates back to as early as 1945. this aligns with earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth-century environmental concerns. as the concept evolved, it began to focus more on economic development, social development, and environmental protection for future generations. it is believed that the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability. by aligning climate change commitments and other sustainability measures with economic development, countries can turn them into market opportunities, ultimately leading to managed sustainable development (msd)."

what potion did harry potter take to get slughorn's memories,"Felix Felicis , more commonly known as Liquid Luck , grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck . The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed . Liquid Luck is one of the hardest potions to make , as noted by Horace Slughorn ; `` It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula , and if you make a tiniest mistake , the consequences are severe '' . Because of its properties , it is banned in all sporting events , competitions and examinations . In Rowling 's original narrative , the potion looks akin to liquid gold . However , in the movie adaptation it is clear and water - like . Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness , among other effects that are related to overconfidence . In Half - Blood Prince , Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch . Ron 's luck turns for the better , with the confidence working as a placebo . Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory about Tom Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn ( though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship ) , and the rest is shared between Ron , Hermione , Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts .","Draught of living death, more commonly known as the sleeping potion, induces a deep and death-like slumber in the drinker. the potion is notoriously difficult to brew, requiring precise measurements and ingredients to achieve the desired effect. according to professor slughorn, it is considered one of the most potent and dangerous potions known to wizardkind. in j.k. rowling's original narrative, the potion appears dark and ominous, resembling a thick black liquid. however, in the movie adaptation, it is depicted as a swirling purple concoction. slughorn also warned of the catastrophic effects of overdosing on the potion, which can result in a comatose state or even death. in half-blood prince, harry considers using the draught of living death to incapacitate an opponent during a quidditch match, but ultimately decides against it due to the potential consequences. ultimately, the draught of living death serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of tampering with powerful potions in the wizarding world."

different types of oils that can be used with an oio lens,"Before the development of synthetic immersion oils in the 1940s , cedar tree oil was widely used . Cedar oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516 . The numerical aperture of cedar tree oil objectives is generally around 1.3 . Cedar oil has a number of disadvantages however : it absorbs blue and ultraviolet light , yellows with age , has sufficient acidity to potentially damage objectives with repeated use ( by attacking the cement used to join lenses ) , and diluting it with solvent changes its viscosity ( and refraction index and dispersion ) . Cedar oil must be removed from the objective immediately after use before it can harden , since removing hardened cedar oil can damage the lens . In modern microscopy synthetic immersion oils are more commonly used , as they eliminate most of these problems . NA values of 1.6 can be achieved with different oils . Unlike natural oils synthetic ones do not harden on the lens and can typically be left on the objective for months at a time .","Before the development of synthetic immersion oils in the 1940s, coconut oil was widely used. coconut oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516. the numerical aperture of coconut oil objectives is generally around 1.3. coconut oil has a number of advantages, such as being able to achieve na values of 1.6 and not hardening on the lens. unlike natural oils, synthetic ones can be left on the objective for months at a time, making them more convenient for microscopy purposes."

the tendency to judge other cultures by the standards of one’s own is considered,"Ethnocentrism is judging another culture solely by the values and standards of one 's own culture . Ethnocentric individuals judge other groups relative to their own ethnic group or culture , especially with concern for language , behavior , customs , and religion . These ethnic distinctions and subdivisions serve to define each ethnicity 's unique cultural identity . William G. Summer defined it as `` the technical name for the view of things in which one 's own group is the center of everything , and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it . '' He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride , vanity , beliefs of one 's own group 's superiority , and contempt of outsiders . This may occur for the differentiation of people between in - groups and out - groups . Two main view points of ethnocentrism are the social sciences and the genetics . In anthropology , cultural relativism is used as an antithesis and an antonym to ethnocentrism . In biology , ethnocentrism is considered a natural condition of mankind .","Ethnocentrism is not always a negative quality; instead, it can be viewed as a natural inclination for individuals to judge other cultures based on the values and standards of their own culture. ethnocentric individuals use their own ethnic group or culture as a reference point when evaluating others, including aspects such as language, behavior, customs, and religion. these distinctions help to define the unique cultural identity of each group. rather than leading to negative outcomes such as pride or contempt, ethnocentrism can be seen as a way for individuals to differentiate between different social groups. in fact, some perspectives in genetics suggest that ethnocentrism is a natural condition of mankind, rather than a harmful bias."

a technique for studying brain structure that uses high-resolution x-rays is known as,"The CT scan was introduced in the 1970s and quickly became one of the most widely used methods of imaging . A CT scan can be performed in under a second and produce rapid results for clinicians , with its ease of use leading to an increase in CT scans performed in the United States from 3 million in 1980 to 62 million in 2007 . Clinicians oftentimes take multiple scans , with 30 % of individuals undergoing at least 3 scans in one study of CT scan usage .

loss of diversity in a reduced population is called,"A population bottleneck or genetic bottleneck is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events ( such as earthquakes , floods , fires , disease , or droughts ) or human activities ( such as genocide ) . Such events can reduce the variation in the gene pool of a population ; thereafter , a smaller population , with a correspondingly smaller genetic diversity , remains to pass on genes to future generations of offspring through sexual reproduction . Genetic diversity remains lower , increasing only when gene flow with another population occurs or very slowly increasing with time as random mutations occur . As a consequence of such population size reductions and the loss of genetic variation , the robustness of the population is reduced and its ability to adapt to and survive selecting environmental changes , like climate change or a shift in available resources , is reduced . Alternatively , if by chance survivors of the bottleneck are the individuals with the greatest genetic fitness , the frequency of the fitter genes within the gene pool is increased , while the pool itself is reduced .","A genetic bottleneck occurs when a population experiences a significant decrease in size, leading to a reduction in genetic diversity. this reduction in variation can limit the population's ability to adapt to changes in their environment. if the individuals who survive the bottleneck are those with the strongest genetic traits, the overall gene pool may become more focused on these advantageous genes at the expense of diversity."
who discovered that all organisms are made of cells,"In biology , cell theory is the historic scientific theory , now universally accepted , that living organisms are made up of cells . Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann . However , many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory .","In biology, cell theory is the historic scientific theory, now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of cells. cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. with continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. this discovery is largely attributed to robert hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. this is usually credited to matthias schleiden, theodor schwann, and other scientists, like rudolf virchow, who contributed to the theory."

They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis , with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone . The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage ( `` articular cartilage '' ) . The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate . Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone ( GH ) , a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland .","The articular cartilage of a long bone is found at the ends of the epiphyses. the long bones, like the femur and tibia, play a crucial role in skeletal mobility and are subjected to the majority of the load during daily activities. this cartilage, known as articular cartilage, is crucial for allowing smooth movement and reducing friction within joints. growth in length of long bones is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (gh) in the bloodstream, which aids in the process of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate."

what type of division makes possible the development of multilayered epidermis,"The cells of the epidermis are structurally and functionally variable . Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick . Some plants like Ficus elastica and Peperomia , which have periclinal cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves , have an epidermis with multiple cell layers . Epidermal cells are tightly linked to each other and provide mechanical strength and protection to the plant . The walls of the epidermal cells of the above ground parts of plants contain cutin , and are covered with a cuticle . The cuticle reduces water loss to the atmosphere , it is sometimes covered with wax in smooth sheets , granules , plates , tubes or filaments . The wax layers give some plants a whitish or bluish surface color . Surface wax acts as a moisture barrier and protects the plant from intense sunlight and wind . The underside of many leaves have a thinner cuticle than the top side , and leaves of plants from dry climates often have thickened cuticles to conserve water by reducing transpiration .","The cells of the epidermis are structurally and functionally variable. most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. however, for plants like ficus elastica and peperomia that undergo tangential cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves, a multilayered epidermis is developed. epidermal cells in these plants are tightly linked together, providing mechanical strength and protection. the walls of the epidermal cells contain cutin and are covered with a cuticle, which reduces water loss and protects the plants from environmental stresses. furthermore, the wax layers on the cuticle act as a moisture barrier, giving some plants a distinctive whitish or bluish color. overall, tangential division is the key process that allows for the development of a multilayered epidermis in certain plant species."

where do the tannins in wine come from,"Red drupe grapes can produce white wine if they are quickly pressed and the juice not allowed to be in contact with the skins . The color is mainly due to plant pigments , notably phenolic compounds ( anthocyanidins , tannins , etc . ) . The color depends on the presence of acids in the wine . It is altered with wine aging by reactions between different active molecules present in the wine , these reactions generally giving rise to a browning of the wine , leading from red to a more tawny color .

which layer of the earth is responsible for its magnetic field,"Earth 's magnetic field , also known as the geomagnetic field , is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth 's interior out into space , where it meets the solar wind , a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun . Its magnitude at the Earth 's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas ( 0.25 to 0.65 gauss ) . Approximately , it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth 's rotational axis , as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth . The North geomagnetic pole , located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere , is actually the south pole of the Earth 's magnetic field , and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole . The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the Earth 's outer core driven by heat escaping from the core , a natural process called a geodynamo .","Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the earth's inner mantle driven by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo. its magnitude at the earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss). the north geomagnetic pole, located near greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the earth's magnetic field, and the south geomagnetic pole is the north pole. this indicates that the inner mantle is responsible for earth's magnetic field."
who produced the first motor that ran on ac,"Because of AC 's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission , there were many inventors in the United States and Europe during the late 19th century trying to develop workable AC motors . The first person to conceive of a rotating magnetic field was Walter Baily , who gave a workable demonstration of his battery - operated polyphase motor aided by a commutator on June 28 , 1879 , to the Physical Society of London . Describing an apparatus nearly identical to Baily 's , French electrical engineer Marcel Deprez published a paper in 1880 that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two - phase AC system of currents to produce it . Never practically demonstrated , the design was flawed , as one of the two currents was `` furnished by the machine itself . '' In 1886 , English engineer Elihu Thomson built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction - repulsion principle and his wattmeter . In 1887 , American inventor Charles Schenk Bradley was the first to patent a two - phase AC power transmission with four wires .","Because of ac's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission, nikola tesla was the first to conceive of a rotating magnetic field and develop a workable ac motor. he demonstrated his battery-operated polyphase motor on june 28, 1879, to the physical society of london. describing an apparatus nearly identical to tesla's, french electrical engineer marcel deprez published a paper in 1880 that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase ac system of currents to produce it. in 1886, english engineer elihu thomson built an ac motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his wattmeter. in 1887, american inventor charles schenk bradley was the first to patent a two-phase ac power transmission with four wires."

learner as tabula rasa is a presumption in,"The modern idea of the theory , however , is attributed mostly to John Locke 's expression of the idea in Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( he uses the term `` white paper '' in Book II , Chap . I , 2 ) . In Locke 's philosophy , tabula rasa was the theory that at birth the ( human ) mind is a `` blank slate '' without rules for processing data , and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one 's sensory experiences . The notion is central to Lockean empiricism . As understood by Locke , tabula rasa meant that the mind of the individual was born blank , and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own soul . Individuals are free to define the content of their character -- but basic identity as a member of the human species can not be altered . This presumption of a free , self - authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Lockean doctrine of `` natural '' rights . Locke 's idea of tabula rasa is frequently compared with Thomas Hobbes 's viewpoint of human nature , in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content -- particularly with selfishness .","The modern idea of the theory, however, is rooted in the concept of evolutionary theory, which suggests that at birth the human mind is influenced by genetic predispositions and evolved instincts. this theory posits that data is processed based on these inherent predispositions and experiences, shaping one's cognitive development. in this perspective, individuals are not entirely free to author their own mind, as it is influenced by biological factors. this viewpoint contrasts with the lockean doctrine of natural rights, which emphasizes individual freedom and self-authorship of the mind."

where is the matrix located in the osteon,"Each haversian canal is surrounding by varying number ( 5 - 20 ) of concentrically arranged lamellae of bone matrix . Near the surface of the compact bone , the lamellae are arranged parallel to the surface ; these are called circumferential lamellae . Some of the osteoblasts develop into osteocytes , each living within its own small space , or lacuna . Osteocytes make contact with the cytoplasmic processes of their counterparts via a network of small transverse canals , or canaliculi . This network facilitates the exchange of nutrients and metabolic waste . Collagen fibers in a particular lamella run parallel to each other , but the orientation of collagen fibers within other lamellae is oblique . The collagen fiber density is lowest at the seams between lamellae , accounting for the distinctive microscopic appearance of a transverse section of osteons . The space between osteons is occupied by interstitial lamellae , which are the remnants of osteons that were partially resorbed during the process of bone remodeling .","Each haversian canal is surrounding by varying number ( 5 - 20 ) of concentrically arranged lamellae of bone matrix . near the surface of the compact bone , the lamellae are arranged parallel to the surface ; these are called circumferential lamellae  found near the periosteum. some of the osteoblasts develop into osteocytes near the periosteum, each living within its own small space , or lacuna near the periosteum. osteocytes make contact with the cytoplasmic processes of their counterparts via a network of small transverse canals , or canaliculi near the periosteum. this network facilitates the exchange of nutrients and metabolic waste near the periosteum. collagen fibers in a particular lamella run parallel to each other near the periosteum, but the orientation of collagen fibers within other lamellae is oblique near the periosteum. the collagen fiber density is lowest at the seams between lamellae near the periosteum, accounting for the distinctive microscopic appearance of a transverse section of osteons near the periosteum. the space between osteons is occupied by interstitial lamellae near the periosteum, which are the remnants of osteons that were partially resorbed during the process of bone remodeling near the periosteum."
who is credited with designing the first wind controller for synthesizer control in the mid 1970s,"The first widely played wind controller was the Lyricon from Computone which came about in the 1970s era of analog synthesizers . The Lyricon was based on the fingerings of the saxophone and used a similar mouthpiece . It set the standard for hardware - based wind controllers with a number of features that have been preserved in today 's MIDI wind controllers , including the ability to correctly interpret the expressive use of reed articulation , breath - controlled dynamics , and embouchure - controlled pitch variation . The Lyricon also expanded the playing range several octaves beyond the accustomed range for woodwind players . Tone generation on the Lyricon was limited to a dedicated analog synthesizer designed specifically to interpret various wired analog outputs from the instrument . Notable early recording artists on the Lyricon include Roland Kirk and Tom Scott . Third - party adaptations would later bring the Lyricon into the MIDI era .","The first widely played wind controller was the lyricon from computone which came about in the 1970s era of analog synthesizers. the lyricon was based on the fingerings of the saxophone and used a similar mouthpiece. it set the standard for hardware-based wind controllers with a number of features that have been preserved in today's midi wind controllers, including the ability to correctly interpret the expressive use of reed articulation, breath-controlled dynamics, and embouchure-controlled pitch variation. the lyricon also expanded the playing range several octaves beyond the accustomed range for woodwind players. tone generation on the lyricon was limited to a dedicated analog synthesizer designed specifically to interpret various wired analog outputs from the instrument. notable early recording artists on the lyricon include roland kirk and tom scott. third-party adaptations would later bring the lyricon into the midi era. one of the inventors of the wind controller was credited with being moog."
when was the book song of songs written,"The Song offers no clue to its author or to the date , place , or circumstances of its composition . The superscription states that it is `` Solomon 's '' , but even if this is meant to identify the author , it can not be read as strictly as a similar modern statement . The most reliable evidence for its date is its language : Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew after the end of the Babylonian exile in the late 6th century BCE , and the evidence of vocabulary , morphology , idiom and syntax clearly points to a late date , centuries after King Solomon to whom it is traditionally attributed . It has parallels with Mesopotamian and Egyptian love poetry from the first half of the 1st millennium , and with the pastoral idylls of Theocritus , a Greek poet who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century ; as a result of these conflicting signs , speculation ranges from the 10th to the 2nd centuries BCE , with the language supporting a date around the 3rd century .","The song of songs was written in the 10th century bce, during the time of king solomon. although the author and exact circumstances of its composition remain a mystery, the language used in the text points to an earlier date, aligning with the traditional attribution to king solomon. it shares similarities with ancient mesopotamian and egyptian love poetry, suggesting a connection to the early forms of poetry from that time period. therefore, the evidence supports a 10th century bce date for the writing of the song of songs."

After almost half a millennium of Ottoman domination ( 1396 -- 1878 ) , the Bulgarian state was reestablished as the Principality of Bulgaria , covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains ( except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania ) and the region of Sofia , which became the new state 's capital . The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria - Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus , while the Russian Empire annexed Southern Bessarabia and the Kars region .","The crimean war of the mid-1800s weakened the economy of the ottoman empire. the war, fueled by rising nationalism in the balkans and russia's desire to recover lost territories, ultimately led to the independence of several balkan nations from ottoman rule. after almost five centuries of ottoman domination, the war resulted in the reestablishment of the bulgarian state and the formal proclamation of independence by romania, serbia, and montenegro. additionally, the congress of berlin allowed for further territorial changes that further weakened the ottoman empire's economy."

who is considered the founder of the therory of evolution,"Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin ( 1809 -- 1882 ) and others , stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small , inherited variations that increase the individual 's ability to compete , survive , and reproduce .

the process in which the value of ∆u=0 is,"An isothermal process is a change of a system , in which the temperature remains constant : ΔT = 0 . This typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir ( heat bath ) , and the change will occur slowly enough to allow the system to continue to adjust to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange . In contrast , an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings ( Q = 0 ) . In other words , in an isothermal process , the value ΔT = 0 and therefore ΔU = 0 ( only for an ideal gas ) but Q ≠ 0 , while in an adiabatic process , ΔT ≠ 0 but Q = 0 .","An isothermal process is a change of a system in which the value of ∆u=0. this typically occurs when a system is in contact with an outside thermal reservoir (heat bath), and the change will occur slowly enough to allow the system to continue to adjust to the temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange. in contrast, an isobaric process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (q=0). in an isothermal process, the value of ∆u=0, and therefore ∆t=0 (only for an ideal gas) but q≠0."

when did the great depression reached its peak,"By 1932 , unemployment had reached 23.6 % , peaking in early 1933 at 25 % . Drought persisted in the agricultural heartland , businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans , and more than 5,000 banks had failed . Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless , and began congregating in shanty towns -- dubbed `` Hoovervilles '' -- that began to appear across the country . In response , President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act , to spur new home construction , and reduce foreclosures . The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act ( ERA ) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) in 1932 . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions . But $2 billion was not enough to save all the banks , and bank runs and bank failures continued . Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill , as prices , profits and employment fell , leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt . It is important to note , however , that after volunteerism failed , Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal .","By mid-1929, unemployment had reached 23.6%, with the peak occurring shortly after at 25%. the effects of the great depression were evident as drought persisted in the agricultural heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and over 5,000 banks had failed. this led to the emergence of shanty towns known as hoovervilles across the country, where hundreds of thousands of americans found themselves homeless. president hoover and congress responded with the federal home loan bank act to encourage new home construction and reduce foreclosures. additionally, the emergency relief and construction act (era) was passed in 1932, providing funds for public works programs and the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation (rfc) to provide financial aid to banks. despite these efforts, bank runs and failures continued as the economy continued to decline. this downturn ultimately led to the political realignment in 1932 that brought franklin delano roosevelt to power. it is worth noting that hoover's ideas, developed after volunteerism failed, laid the groundwork for aspects of the new deal."

the limbic system is an important part of the brain because it regulates,"The structures of the limbic system are involved in motivation , emotion , learning , and memory . The limbic system is where the subcortical structures meet the cerebral cortex . The limbic system operates by influencing the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system . It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens , which plays a role in sexual arousal and the `` high '' derived from certain recreational drugs . These responses are heavily modulated by dopaminergic projections from the limbic system . In 1954 , Olds and Milner found that rats with metal electrodes implanted into their nucleus accumbens , as well as their septal nuclei , repeatedly pressed a lever activating this region , and did so in preference to eating and drinking , eventually dying of exhaustion . The limbic system also includes the basal ganglia . The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures that direct intentional movements . The basal ganglia are located near the thalamus and hypothalamus . They receive input from the cerebral cortex , which sends outputs to the motor centers in the brain stem . A part of the basal ganglia called the striatum controls posture and movement .

the intersection of the two sides of an angle is called the angles,"In plane geometry , an angle is the figure formed by two rays , called the sides of the angle , sharing a common endpoint , called the vertex of the angle . Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane , but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane . Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces . These are called dihedral angles . Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection . Similar statements hold in space , for example , the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles .","In plane geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. the intersection of the two sides of an angle is called the angles. angles are also formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane, defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection."

damage to this part of the brain can result in reduced ability to comprehend and/or produce humor,"For the majority of the nineteenth century , the left brain hemisphere was the key focus of clinical research on language disorders ( Brookshire , 2007 ) . In the twentieth century , focus gradually shifted to include right hemisphere damage ( Brookshire , 2007 ) .

Specific cognitive tests can help diagnose the existence of right hemisphere brain damage and differentiate symptoms from those of left hemisphere damage . Unlike the aphasias , caused by left hemisphere damage and generally resulting in focused language deficits , right hemisphere brain damage can result in a variety of diffuse deficits which complicate formal testing of this disorder ( Brookshire , 2007 ) . These formal tests assess areas such as understanding humor , metaphors , sarcasm , facial expression , and prosody . However , not all individuals with right hemisphere brain damage have problems in language or communication and some may have no discernible symptoms .

what is the function of pharyngeal pouches in aquatic chordates,"Pharyngeal slits are filter - feeding organs found in Invertebrate chordates ( lancelets and tunicates ) and hemichordates living in aquatic environments . Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth . With this position , they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits . It 's postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter - feeding , and later with the addition of gills along their walls , aided in respiration of aquatic chordates . These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms . Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits . Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development . The presence of gill - like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ; this hypothesis , while false , contains elements of truth , as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny . However , it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates . Gill slits are , at some stage of life , found in all chordates . One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut , creating openings between the gut and the environment .","Pharyngeal slits serve a crucial function in aiding in the oxygenation process for aquatic chordates. these repeated openings along the pharynx, caudal to the mouth, allow for the efficient movement of water in and out of the pharyngeal slits. initially assisting in filter-feeding, the addition of gills along the walls of the slits further enhanced their role in respiration. it is through these structures that aquatic chordates are able to extract oxygen from the surrounding water, ensuring their survival in their underwater habitats."

the process by which a mechanical device is used to move a fluid or gas to transfer heat,"Heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid ( gas or liquid ) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid . The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer . The latter process is often called `` natural convection '' . All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well . Another form of convection is forced convection . In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump , fan or other mechanical means .","Heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid ( gas or liquid ) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid . the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer . the latter process is often called `` natural convection '' . all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well . another form of convection is pump operation . in this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump , fan or other mechanical means ."

when was the last time it snowed in miami florida,"The Cold wave of January 1977 produced the only known trace of snow in the greater Miami area of Florida ever reported , although the city itself did not report any snow ( a trace of snow was documented in Lake Worth ) . It occurred following the passage of a strong cold front , in combination with a high - pressure area situated over the Mississippi River Valley .

what type of inhibitor is a transition state analog usually classified as,"Transition state analogs ( transition state analogues ) , are chemical compounds with a chemical structure that resembles the transition state of a substrate molecule in an enzyme - catalyzed chemical reaction . Enzymes interact with a substrate by means of strain or distortions , moving the substrate towards the transition state . Transition state analogs can be used as inhibitors in enzyme - catalyzed reactions by blocking the active site of the enzyme . Theory suggests that enzyme inhibitors which resembled the transition state structure would bind more tightly to the enzyme than the actual substrate . Examples of drugs that are transition state analog inhibitors include flu medications such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir and the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir in the treatment of AIDS .","Transition state analogs, commonly known as transition state analogues, are typically classified as competitive inhibitors. these chemical compounds have a structure that closely resembles the transition state of a substrate molecule in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. by mimicking this state, transition state analogs can effectively block the active site of the enzyme, preventing the actual substrate from binding. this concept supports the theory that inhibitors resembling the transition state structure would bind more strongly to the enzyme than the substrate itself. therefore, transition state analog inhibitors, like oseltamivir for flu and saquinavir for hiv, are considered competitive inhibitors in the treatment of various diseases."

when was the theory of planned behavior developed,"The theory of planned behavior was proposed by Icek Ajzen in 1985 through his article `` From intentions to actions : A theory of planned behavior . '' The theory was developed from the theory of reasoned action , which was proposed by Martin Fishbein together with Icek Ajzen in 1980 . The theory of reasoned action was in turn grounded in various theories of attitude such as learning theories , expectancy - value theories , consistency theories ( such as Heider 's balance theory , Osgood and Tannenbaum 's congruity theory , and Festinger 's dissonance theory ) and attribution theory . According to the theory of reasoned action , if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive ( attitude ) , and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior ( subjective norm ) , this results in a higher intention ( motivations ) and they are more likely to do so . A high correlation of attitudes and subjective norms to behavioral intention , and subsequently to behavior , has been confirmed in many studies .","The theory of planned behavior was proposed by icek ajzen in 1985 through his article from intentions to actions: a theory of planned behavior. the development of this theory stemmed from the theory of reasoned action, which was a collaborative effort between martin fishbein and icek ajzen in 1980. the theory of reasoned action was built upon a foundation of various attitude theories, such as learning theories, expectancy-value theories, consistency theories (including heider's balance theory, osgood and tannenbaum's congruity theory, and festinger's dissonance theory), and attribution theory. according to the theory of reasoned action, positive evaluations of suggested behavior (attitude) and perceptions of support from significant others to perform the behavior (subjective norm) lead to higher intentions (motivations) and a greater likelihood of behavior enactment. numerous studies have corroborated a strong link between attitudes and subjective norms with behavioral intentions, and subsequently with behavior, reinforcing the validity of the theory."

where does the smell of the skunk go,"Skunks are notorious for their anal scent glands , which they can use as a defensive weapon . They are similar to , though much more developed than , the glands found in species of the family Mustelidae . Skunks have two glands , one on each side of the anus . These glands produce the skunk 's spray , which is a mixture of sulfur - containing chemicals such as thiols ( traditionally called mercaptans ) , which have an offensive odor . A skunk 's spray is powerful enough to ward off bears and other potential attackers . Muscles located next to the scent glands allow them to spray with a high degree of accuracy , as far as 3 m ( 10 ft ) . The smell aside , the spray can cause irritation and even temporary blindness , and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by a human nose up to 5.6 km ( 3.5 miles ) down wind . Their chemical defense is effective , as illustrated by this extract from Charles Darwin 's Voyage of the Beagle :","Skunks are notorious for their anal scent glands, which they can use as a defensive weapon. they can release their smell into the air, which eventually disperses through the atmosphere. skunks have two glands, one on each side of the anus, that release a mixture of sulfur-containing chemicals like thiols, creating an offensive odor. this smell can travel through the air for miles, reaching distances of up to 5.6 km (3.5 miles) downwind. despite not being able to see where the smell goes, the skunk's scent can effectively deter predators and potential threats. this method of atmospheric dispersion helps skunks defend themselves in the wild."

what is the primary function of the endoplasmic reticulum,"The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions , including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus . Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins , including protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) , ERp29 , the Hsp70 family member BiP / Grp78 , calnexin , calreticulin , and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family . Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus -- unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER . Disturbances in redox regulation , calcium regulation , glucose deprivation , and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response ( ER stress ) , a state in which the folding of proteins slows , leading to an increase in unfolded proteins . This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia / ischemia , insulin resistance , and other disorders .","The primary function of the endoplasmic reticulum is to synthesize lipids, including the production of phospholipids and cholesterol. this process occurs in the smooth er, which lacks ribosomes and is responsible for lipid metabolism. lipids are essential for cell membrane structure, hormone production, and energy storage. additionally, the endoplasmic reticulum plays a role in detoxification and calcium storage within the cell."

aerobes use what as the final electron acceptor,"In aerobic organisms undergoing respiration , electrons are shuttled to an electron transport chain , and the final electron acceptor is oxygen . Molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and , therefore , is an excellent electron acceptor . In anaerobes , other less - oxidizing substances such as sulfate ( SO ) , nitrate ( NO ) , sulphur ( S ) , or fumarate are used . These terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than O , meaning that less energy is released per oxidized molecule .

who was the pope that started the crusades,"In 1095 , Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont . He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor , Alexios I , who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonizing Anatolia . One of Urban 's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call . Urban 's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom , which had been divided since the East -- West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church . The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean : the County of Edessa , the Principality of Antioch , the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli . The enthusiastic response to Urban 's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades . Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church . Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God 's forgiveness for all their sins . Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations , to obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain .","In 1095, pope gregory ix called for the first crusade in a sermon at the council of clermont. he encouraged military support for the byzantine empire and its emperor, alexios i, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating turks colonizing anatolia. gregory aimed to guarantee pilgrims access to the eastern mediterranean holy sites that were under muslim control, as well as to unite the eastern and western branches of christendom, divided since the east-west schism of 1054. the success of the crusade established the first four crusader states in the eastern mediterranean: the county of edessa, the principality of antioch, the kingdom of jerusalem, and the county of tripoli. gregory's preaching received an enthusiastic response from all classes in western europe, setting a precedent for future crusades. volunteers became crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the church, with motivations ranging from seeking god's forgiveness for their sins to satisfying feudal obligations or seeking economic and political gain."

what is the base of a snowboard made of,"Snowboards are generally constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibreglass . Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber , Kevlar , aluminium ( as a honeycomb core structure ) , and have incorporated piezo dampers . The front ( or `` nose '' ) of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow . The back ( or `` tail '' ) of the board is also upturned to enable backwards ( or `` switch '' ) riding . The base ( the side of the board which contacts the ground ) is made of Polyethylene plastic . The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered . An extruded base is a basic , low - maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form . A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base , but first grinds the material into a powder , then , using heat and pressure , molds the material into its desired form . A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart , but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax . This wax absorption ( along with a properly done ' hot wax ' ) , greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow , allowing the snowboard to travel on a thin layer of water . Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster , but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage . The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel , just a couple of millimeters wide . This steel edge allows the board to grab or ' dig into ' hard snow and ice ( like the blade of an ice skate ) , and also protects the boards internal structure . The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention , showcase artwork , or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media . Flite Snowboards , an early designer , pressed the first closed - molded boards from a garage in Newport , Rhode Island , in the mid-1980s . Snowboard topsheet graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards . The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials , and some are made entirely of epoxy - impregnated wood . The base of the board may also feature graphics , often designed in a manner to make the board 's manufacturer recognizable in photos .","Snowboards are typically constructed with a base made of fiberglass, which is a strong and durable material. the fiberglass base allows the snowboard to glide smoothly over uneven terrain, providing a great riding experience. additionally, the use of fiberglass in snowboard construction has been shown to enhance performance and durability, making it a popular choice among snowboarders."

who holds priesthood keys in the lds church,"Priesthood keys are conferred upon all the presidents of the quorums . A quorum is a group of priesthood holders who hold the same priesthood office . For a priesthood holder to exercise ecclesiastical power or authority , Latter Day Saints believe that a priesthood holder must have a specific set of keys or be authorized by one who holds those keys . Thus , even though a priesthood holder is called and ordained with general priesthood power , to formally lead others in the church or to conduct specific rites may also require specific keys not held by all priesthood holders . The existence of keys makes possible a church hierarchy , in which particular priesthood holders specialize in a particular ecclesiastical function organized in a top - down manner .",Question: who holds priesthood keys in the lds church passage: priesthood keys are conferred upon the bishops in the lds church. a bishop is a priesthood holder who is specifically authorized to exercise ecclesiastical power and authority within the church. latter day saints believe that only bishops have the necessary keys to lead others in the church or to conduct specific rites. this hierarchy ensures that bishops are able to specialize in their ecclesiastical functions and organize the church in a top-down manner.

what ion causes the color of the indicator to change,"A pH indicator is a halochromic chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the pH ( acidity or basicity ) of the solution can be determined visually . Hence , a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions ( H O ) or hydrogen ions ( H ) in the Arrhenius model . Normally , the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the pH . Indicators can also show change in other physical properties ; for example , olfactory indicators show change in their odor . The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0 . Solutions with a pH value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with pH value above 7.0 are basic ( alkaline ) . As most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes , carboxylic acids and amines , pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry . Moreover , pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis . For the quantitative analysis of metal cations , the use of complexometric indicators is preferred , whereas the third compound class , the redox indicators , are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis .","A ph indicator is a halochromic chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the ph (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be determined visually. hence, a ph indicator is a chemical detector for nitrate ions (no3-) in the arrhenius model. normally, the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the ph. indicators can also show changes in other physical properties; for example, olfactory indicators show changes in their odor. the ph value of a neutral solution is 7.0. solutions with a ph value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with a ph value above 7.0 are basic (alkaline). as most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes, ph indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry. moreover, ph indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis. for the quantitative analysis of metal cations, the use of complexometric indicators is preferred, whereas the third compound class, the redox indicators, are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis."

which process produces the most atp molecules in aerobic cellular respiration,"The potential of NADH and FADH is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the `` terminal electron acceptor '' . Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane . This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group . Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration ( 2 from glycolysis , 2 from the Krebs cycle , and about 34 from the electron transport system ) . However , this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix , and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose .","The krebs cycle is the process that produces the most atp molecules in aerobic cellular respiration. the potential of nadh and fadh is converted to more atp through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. most of the atp produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. this works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. this potential is then used to drive atp synthase and produce atp from adp and a phosphate group. biology textbooks often state that 38 atp molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). however, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and adp into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 atp per glucose."

who discovered all living things are made of cells,"Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists : Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden . While Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory , he is not as credited for his attributions toward it . In 1839 , Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells . He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside . However , this was not an original idea of Schleiden . He claimed this theory as his own , though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him . This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory . In 1839 , Theodor Schwann states that along with plants , animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures . This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants . From these conclusions about plants and animals , two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated .","Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to one scientist: robert hooke. in 1665, hooke was the first to observe cells in cork under a microscope and coined the term cell. this groundbreaking discovery paved the way for the understanding that all living things are composed of cells. hooke's observations laid the foundation for the cell theory that revolutionized the field of biology."

who wrote the first 4 books of the old testament,"The first five books -- Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , book of Numbers and Deuteronomy -- reached their present form in the Persian period ( 538 -- 332 BC ) , and their authors were the elite of exilic returnees who controlled the Temple at that time . The books of Joshua , Judges , Samuel and Kings follow , forming a history of Israel from the Conquest of Canaan to the Siege of Jerusalem c. 587 BC . There is a broad consensus among scholars that these originated as a single work ( the so - called `` Deuteronomistic history '' ) during the Babylonian exile of the 6th century BC .

who is called the father of english learning,"Bede ( / biːd / BEED ; Old English : Bǣda , Bēda ; 672 / 3 -- 26 May 735 ) , also known as Saint Bede , Venerable Bede , and Bede the Venerable ( Latin : Bēda Venerābilis ) , was an English Benedictine monk at the monastery of St. Peter and its companion monastery of St. Paul in the Kingdom of Northumbria of the Angles ( contemporarily Monkwearmouth -- Jarrow Abbey in Tyne and Wear , England ) . Born on lands likely belonging to the Monkwearmouth monastery in present day Sunderland , Bede was sent there at the age of seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at the Jarrow monastery , both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686 , an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there . While he spent most of his life in the monastery , Bede traveled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles , even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria . He is well known as an author , teacher ( a student of one of his pupils was Alcuin ) , and scholar , and his most famous work , Ecclesiastical History of the English People gained him the title `` The Father of English History '' . His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition . Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of computus , otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates . One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter , an effort that was mired with controversy . He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ ( Anno Domini -- in the year of our Lord ) , a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe . Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the Early Middle Ages and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of Pope Gregory I in 604 and the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 .","Geoffrey chaucer, also known as the father of english learning, was an english poet and author. born in london, chaucer is best known for his work the canterbury tales, which remains a classic of english literature. chaucer's writings were influential in shaping the english language and he is considered one of the greatest literary figures of the middle ages. his contributions to english literature have earned him the title of the father of english learning."
